# TYT MOGLA BbITb VASHA REKLAMA!

This project provides a widget to display and process bank operations data.  It includes functions for filtering and sorting operations.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Create a `requirements.txt` with `masks` library inside)

## Usage

The main script is `main.py`.  It imports functions from the `src/processing.py`, `src/masks.py`, and `src/generators.py` module.

To run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

▌Example
=======
The script uses sample data to demonstrate the functionality.   
You can modify the test_data in main.py to use your own data. 
The main.py script now also demonstrates the use of the @log decorator. 
Logs will be output to the console unless a filename is specified when 
applying the decorator (e.g., @log(filename="app.log")).

▌Functions
=======
•  decorators.py: Contains the log decorator for automatic logging of function execution, 
   including successful results and exceptions.

•  filter_by_state(operations, state='EXECUTED'): Filters a list of operations dictionaries by the state key.
   Returns a new list containing only operations with the specified state.

•  sort_by_date(operations, reverse=True): Sorts a list of operation dictionaries by the date key.
   Returns a new list sorted by date, in descending order by default.

•  mask_account_card(data): Masks sensitive information in account or card numbers. 
   Automatically detects the type of data and applies appropriate masking.

•  get_data(date_string): Converts date strings to a specific format (DD.MM.YYYY).

•  get_mask_card_number(card_number): Masks a card number, revealing only the first 6 and last 4 digits.

•  get_mask_account(account_number): Masks an account number, revealing only the last 4 digits.

•  filter_by_currency(transactions, currency_code): Filters a list of transactions based on the specified currency code.

•  transaction_descriptions(transactions): Extracts the description from each transaction in a list.

•  card_number_generator(start, end): Generates a sequence of formatted card numbers within a specified range, useful for testing purposes.

▌The log Decorator
====
The @log decorator is used to automatically log the execution of functions.

▌USEAGE:
===
from decorators import log
````
@log
def my_function(x, y):
    return x + y

@log(filename="mylog.txt")
def another_function(x, y):
    raise ValueError("Something went wrong")
````
▌Features:
=
•  Logs the start and end of function execution.
•  Logs successful results.
•  Logs exceptions, including the exception type, message, and input arguments.
•  Can log to the console or to a file.

▌Testing
==
This project includes a comprehensive suite of tests written using pytest. The tests cover the following aspects:

▌Test Coverage
==
•  masks.py:
  •  Correctly masks card numbers with different formats and lengths.
  •  Correctly masks account numbers with different lengths.
  •  Handles edge cases such as empty strings and None inputs.

•  widget.py:
  •  Correctly identifies and masks card and account numbers based on input type.
  •  Transforms date strings into the desired format (DD.MM.YYYY).
  •  Handles invalid date formats gracefully (returns None or raises an exception depending on the implementation).

•  processing.py:
  •  Filters lists of operations dictionaries correctly based on state.
  •  Sorts lists of operations dictionaries correctly by date in both ascending and descending order.
  •  Handles missing or invalid dates in the data.

•  tests/test_generators.py:
  •  Filters transaction lists by currency code accurately.
  •  Extracts transaction descriptions correctly from lists of transactions.
  •  Generates valid card numbers within the specified range.

▌Running Tests
==
1. Make sure you have pytest installed (pip install pytest).
2. Navigate to the project's root directory (where the tests/ folder is located).
3. Run the tests using the following command:  
````bash
pytest
 ````
4. To generate a coverage report (showing which parts of the code are tested), use: 
````bash
pytest --cov=.
````

This will run all tests in the tests/ directory and display the results. A coverage report will also be generated, indicating the percentage of code covered by the tests. You can view a detailed HTML report with:
````bash
pytest --cov=. --cov-report html
````

This will create a html cov directory with an index.html file to view coverage results in your browser.
